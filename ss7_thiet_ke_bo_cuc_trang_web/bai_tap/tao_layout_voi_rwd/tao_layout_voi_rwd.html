            <h1>Welcome</h1>
            <p> Most of my friends like to stay inside to play video games, read books or watch TV, but I have a good
                hobby of going outside and playing sports. I play many different sports in my free time; some of them
                are soccer, swimming, volleyball and basketball. Sometimes I also ride the bikes or do board skating
                with my cousin in the park. In my opinion, doing sport is one of the rare hobbies that actually
                have good impacts on me. I am taller than most of my classmates thanks to swimming and basketball
                lessons that I take during summer time.
                My muscles are even stronger than my older brother, and I can last longer than most other people in
                any sport competition. Sports bring me a lot of benefits, and they are also fun things to do at the same
                time. I love the feeling of the cool water run through my face when I am swimming, and it seems like I
                am flying whenever I take a dive underwater. When I play soccer, it is very exciting for me or my
                teammates to score a goal even though we do not take part in any tournament. Both of my physical
                and mental health become better after I play sports, so it can be considered as the best things to do
                in my free time.
